# 🧠 Contextual Coding With AI (CCWI)

> **Revolutionizing how developers collaborate with AI — context-first, not chaos-first.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**CCWI** (Contextual Coding With AI) is a developer toolkit and workflow system that integrates multiple AI coding assistants directly into your development environment.

Inspired by Ashley Ha’s *Claude Code Workflow*, CCWI extends the concept beyond a single AI model — enabling teams to orchestrate **Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, DeepSeek**, and others inside VS Code or terminal workflows.

Think of it as your **AI DevOps brain**: structured, sharable, and scalable.

## 🧩 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| 🧠 **Context Engineering** | Always deliver the right context at the right time — never overload the AI. |
| 🔄 **Structured Workflow** | Work in four phases: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate. |
| 🤝 **Human-in-the-loop** | AI assists, you decide. Every phase is reviewable, auditable, and shareable. |
| 🧰 **Multi-AI Integration** | Choose your assistant: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, or any local LLM. |
| 💾 **Thought Persistence** | Every decision is stored in `/thoughts/` for cross-project learning. |
